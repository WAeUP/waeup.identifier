Installation
============

`waeup.identifier` is based on `kivy`_. Installing `kivy`_, requires
several libs to be installed. For convenience we created suitable
`ansible`_ playbooks that can (at least on Debian_-based systems,
including raspbian and Ubuntu) install all required stuff at once.

For development we recommend to run the `ansible`_ driven variant on
localhost as described below.

You can of course install all parts manually.
