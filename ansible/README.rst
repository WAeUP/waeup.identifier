ansible
-------

This is the place for scripts helping with provisioning RaspberryPi
devices for use of `waeup.identifier`.

The `hosts` file is an ansible inventory file. The IP set in it must be set to the real IP of your local raspberry pi.

It also sets a username to connect to the device. If you use another
username, replace `pi`.
